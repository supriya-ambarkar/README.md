## Projects

#### Automated Personality Prediction using Machine Learning

- The model uses learning algorithms and advanced data mining concepts to mine user characteristics data and learn from the patterns. 
- In this project, we are implementing the KNN algorithm without using inbuilt functions. 
- This project will come across areas where it has access to large amounts of personal behavioral data. 
- Personality traits are the five dimensions or the domains of personality that can be used to analyze or predict a user's personality. 

#### Alzheimer Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning Algorithms

- The ultimate goal of Alzheimer's disease prediction using machine learning algorithms is to provide a simple and efficient method for early prediction of the disease. 
- This approach can help to identify individuals who are at high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, enabling earlier diagnosis, and personalized treatment.
